@theme @theme_charteredcollege @_bug_phantomjs
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to charteredcollege, only teachers should see an admin settings link.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher visits course.
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
   Then "#admin-menu-trigger" "css_element" should exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: Student visits course.
    Given I log in as "student1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
   Then "#admin-menu-trigger" "css_element" should not exist
