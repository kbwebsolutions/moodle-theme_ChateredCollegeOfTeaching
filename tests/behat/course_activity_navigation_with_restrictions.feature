Feature: Activity navigation involving activities with access restrictions in charteredcollege theme
  In order to quickly switch to another activity that has access restrictions
  As a student
  I need to be able to use the activity navigation feature to access the activity after satisfying its access conditions

    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    # Set completion for Forum 1.
    And I follow "Edit \"Forum 1\""
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Completion tracking" to "Show activity as complete when conditions are met"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Completion tracking | Show activity as complete when conditions are met |
      | Require view        | 1                                                 |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    # Require Forum 1 to be completed first before Chat 1 can be accessed.
    And I follow "Edit \"Chat 1\""
    # And I click on "Edit settings" "link" in the "Chat 1" activity.
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "//button[text()=\"Activity completion\"]" "xpath_element"
    And I set the field "Activity or resource" to "Forum 1"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I log out

  @javascript
  Scenario: Activity navigation involving activities with access restrictions
    Given I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I click on "//h3/a/p[contains(text(),'Assignment 1')]" "xpath_element"
    Then I should see "Forum 1" in the "#next-activity-link" "css_element"
    # Activity that has access restriction should not show up in the dropdown.
    And the "Jump to..." select box should not contain "Chat 1"
    And I select "Quiz 1" from the "Jump to..." singleselect
    # Forum 1 should be shown in the previous link since Chat 1 is not yet available.
    And I should see "Forum 1" in the "#prev-activity-link" "css_element"
    And the "Jump to..." select box should not contain "Chat 1"
    # Navigate to Forum 1.
    And I click on "//div/a[contains(text(),'Forum 1')]" "xpath_element"
    # Since Forum 1 has now been viewed and deemed completed, Chat 1 can now be accessed.
    And I should see "Chat 1" in the "#next-activity-link" "css_element"
    And the "Jump to..." select box should contain "Chat 1"
