@theme @theme_charteredcollege @theme_charteredcollege_course
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to charteredcollege, students do not see the course admin menu for 'topics',
  'weeks' and 'singleactivity' - for any other format they do.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student   | 1        | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: When on main course page, user can / cannot access course admin menu. Students can access menu for
  any format except topics, weeks, and singleactivity. Teachers can access menu for all course formats.
    Given the course format for "C1" is set to "<format>"
    And I log in as "<user>"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    Then "#admin-menu-trigger" "css_element" should <existornot>
  Examples:
    | user     | format         | existornot |
    | student1 | topics         | not exist  |
    | student1 | weeks          | not exist  |
    | student1 | singleactivity | not exist  |
    | student1 | social         | exist      |
    | teacher1 | topics         | exist      |
    | teacher1 | weeks          | exist      |
    | teacher1 | singleactivity | exist      |
    | teacher1 | social         | exist      |
