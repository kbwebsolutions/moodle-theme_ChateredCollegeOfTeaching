@theme @theme_charteredcollege
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to charteredcollege, course layout cannot be changed to all course on one section.

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | theme | charteredcollege |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode | theme |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 | |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher sees a warning message and is unable to choose incorrect course layout.
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I click on "#admin-menu-trigger" "css_element"
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I click on "#id_courseformathdr" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Due to its design language, \"Show all sections on one page\" isn't available in charteredcollege."
    And I click on "[name=\"coursedisplay\"]" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Show all sections on one page (Disabled)"
