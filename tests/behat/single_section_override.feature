@theme @theme_charteredcollege
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to charteredcollege, courses in single section per page mode are forced to operate with all
  sections displayed at the same time.

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | teacher2 | Teacher | 2 | teacher2@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format | coursedisplay |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics | 1             |
    # In the above, coursedisplay 1 means that the course will display single section at a time.
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | admin    | C1     | editingteacher |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | teacher2 | C1     | teacher        |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |

  @javascript
  Scenario: All users see course pages rendered in regular mode even when course single section per page mode set.

    # Test with admin user.

    And I log out

    # Test with editing teacher.
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    Then I can see course "C1" in all sections mode
    And I log out
