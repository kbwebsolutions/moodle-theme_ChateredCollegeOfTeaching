  Scenario: Url type and Url autocomplete should exists for input Url in the "Add entry" for Database activity.
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    # Create database activity and allow editing of
    # approved entries.
    And I add a "Database" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Name              | Test database name |
      | Description       | Test               |
    And I click on "li.modtype_data a.mod-link" "css_element"
    # To generate the default templates.
    And I click on "//div[@class='fieldadd']//select[@class='custom-select singleselect']//option[@value='url']" "xpath_element"
    And I set the field "Field name" to "Data URL"
    And I click on "Add" "button"
    And I should see "Field added"
    And I click on "//a[contains(@title, 'Add entry')]" "xpath_element"
    And the "type" attribute of "input.mod-data-input.form-control.d-inline" "css_element" should contain "url"
    And the "autocomplete" attribute of "input.mod-data-input.form-control.d-inline" "css_element" should contain "url"
