@theme @theme_charteredcollege @theme_charteredcollege_footer
Feature: As an admin, I should be able to set a site's footer on charteredcollege theme.

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
        | theme | charteredcollege |
        | linkadmincategories | 0 |
      And the following "users" exist:
        | username | firstname | lastname | email |
        | user1    | User1     | 1        | user1@example.com |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Admin sets a footer and it should be visible in the platform for other users.
    Given I log in as "admin"
      And I am on site homepage
      And "iframe" "css_element" should not be visible
      And I should not see "New footer"
      And I click on "#admin-menu-trigger" "css_element"
      And I expand "Site administration" node
      And I expand "Appearance" node
      And I expand "Themes" node
      And I follow "charteredcollege"
     Then I should see "Site footer"
      And I set the following fields to these values:
        | Site footer | <iframe></iframe> <p>New footer</p>|
      And I click on "Save changes" "button"
      And I wait until the page is ready
     Then I should see "New footer"
      And "iframe" "css_element" should be visible
      And I log out
      And I should see "New footer"
     Then "iframe" "css_element" should be visible
      And I log in as "user1"
      And I am on site homepage
     Then I should see "New footer"
      And "iframe" "css_element" should be visible
      And I log out
