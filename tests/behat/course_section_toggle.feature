  edit mode.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | admin | C1 | editingteacher |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: In read mode, teacher hides section.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | coursepartialrender | <Option> | theme_charteredcollege |
    And I log out
    Then I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I follow "Topic 2"
    Then "#section-2" "css_element" should exist
    And "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3).charteredcollege-visible-section" "css_element" should exist
    And "#section-2.hidden" "css_element" should not exist
    And I click on "#section-2 .charteredcollege-visibility.charteredcollege-hide" "css_element"
    And I wait until "#section-2 .charteredcollege-visibility.charteredcollege-show" "css_element" exists
    Then "#section-2.hidden" "css_element" should exist
    And "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3).charteredcollege-visible-section" "css_element" should exist
    # Make sure that the navigation either side of section 2 has the dimmed class - i.e. to reflect section 2's hidden status.
    And I follow "Topic 3"
    And I follow "Topic 2"
    And the previous navigation for section "3" shows as hidden
    And I follow "Topic 1"
    And I follow "Topic 2"
    And the next navigation for section "1" shows as hidden
    # Note, the Not published to students message is in the 3rd element of the TOC because element 1 is section 0.
    And I should see "Not published to students" in the "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3)" "css_element"
    # Let's make the section visible again
    Given I click on "#section-2 .charteredcollege-visibility.charteredcollege-show" "css_element"
    And I wait until "#section-2 .charteredcollege-visibility.charteredcollege-hide" "css_element" exists
    Then "#section-2.hidden" "css_element" should not exist
    And I should not see "Not published to students" in the "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3)" "css_element"
    # Make sure that the navigation either side of section 2 does not have the dimmed class - i.e. to reflect section 2's visible status.
    And the previous navigation for section "3" shows as visible
    And the next navigation for section "1" shows as visible
