  Scenario: As a teacher I shouldn't see the option "Custom" on editing a section with topics format.
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I click on "#section-0 .summary .edit-summary" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Custom" in the ".charteredcollege-form-required .fdefaultcustom .form-check-inline" "css_element"
    And I am on "Course 2" course homepage
    And I click on "#section-1 .summary .edit-summary" "css_element"
