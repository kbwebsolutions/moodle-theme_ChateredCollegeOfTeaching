@theme @theme_charteredcollege @theme_charteredcollege_course @theme_charteredcollege_course
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to charteredcollege, teachers can toggle the currently higlighted course sections.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | admin | C1 | editingteacher |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: In read mode, teacher toggles section as current and student sees appropriate status.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | coursepartialrender | <Option> | theme_charteredcollege |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I follow "Topic 2"
    Then "#section-2" "css_element" should exist
    And "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3).charteredcollege-visible-section" "css_element" should exist

    And I click on "#section-2 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element"
    And I wait until "#section-2 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element" exists
    # Note: nth-of-type(3) corresponds to the second section in the TOC.
    And I should see "Current" in the "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3)" "css_element"
    And "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3).charteredcollege-visible-section" "css_element" should exist
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    Then I should see "Current" in the "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3)" "css_element"
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I follow "Topic 2"
    Given I click on "#section-2 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element"
    And I wait until "#section-2 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element" exists
    Then I should not see "Current" in the "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3)" "css_element"
    And "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3).charteredcollege-visible-section" "css_element" should exist
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    Then I should not see "Current" in the "#chapters li:nth-of-type(3)" "css_element"
  Examples:
    | Option     |
    | 0          |
    | 1          |

  @javascript
  # This scenario is necessary to make sure the correct error message comes back when an AJAX request fails but it is
  # not related to a session time out / the user being logged out.
  Scenario: Teacher loses teacher capability whilst course open and receives the correct error message when trying to
  highlight section.
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And the editing teacher role is removed from course "C1" for "teacher1"
    And I follow "Topic 1"
    Then "#section-1" "css_element" should exist
    And I click on "#section-1 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element"
    # Shame to have a 1 second pause here but this fails on CI intermittently without this pause.
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And I should see "Failed to highlight section"
    Then I log out
    And I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | coursepartialrender | 1 | theme_charteredcollege |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I follow "Topic 1"
    And "#section-1 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element" should not exist

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: Student cannot mark section current.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | coursepartialrender | <Option> | theme_charteredcollege |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I follow "Topic 2"
    Then "#section-2 .charteredcollege-highlight" "css_element" should not exist
  Examples:
  | Option     |
  | 0          |
  | 1          |
